bashers of Pens fans are pretty confused about the lack\\nof any kind of posts about the recent Pens massacre of the Devils. Actually,\\nI am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end\\nto non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they\\nare killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why\\nhe is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot\\nfo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of\\nfun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final\\nregular season game.          PENS RULE!!!\\n\\n\n",

DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices\\nit is attached when it wants to.\\n\\nAn important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the\\nSCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to\\nstart transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the\\nbus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are\\nready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.\\n\\nOn an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked\\nthe data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other\\nprocesses wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.\\n\n",

                     1)    I have an old Jasmine drive which I cannot use with my new system.\\n My understanding is that I have to upsate the driver with a more modern\\none in order to gain compatability with system 7.0.1.  does anyone know\\nof an inexpensive program to do this?  ( I have seen formatters for <$20\\nbuit have no idea if they will work)\\n \\n2)     I have another ancient device, this one a tape drive for which\\nthe back utility freezes the system if I try to use it.  THe drive is a\\njasmine direct tape (bought used for $150 w/ 6 tapes, techmar\\nmechanism).  Essentially I have the same question as above, anyone know\\nof an inexpensive beckup utility I can use with system 7.0.1\n",

Bell Labs.  When they were doing visual perception and\\nmemory experiments, they used vector-type displays, with 1-millisecond\\nrefresh rates common.\\n\\nSo your case of 1/200th sec is quite practical, and the experimenters were\\nprobably sure that it was 5 milliseconds, not 4 or 6 either.\\n\\n\\nSteve\n",

Move to Canada.  Yesterday I was able\\nto watch FOUR games...the NJ-PITT at 1:00 on ABC, LA-CAL at 3:00 (CBC), \\nBUFF-BOS at 7:00 (TSN and FOX), and MON-QUE at 7:30 (CBC).  I think that if\\neach series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd\\nconsecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess).\\n\\nI have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE\\nand keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two\\nafternoon games.\\n\\nBtw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemed\\nto know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore\\nand they did an excellent job.  They were quite impartial also, IMO.\\n\\n\n",

the second one.  And I believe that price too.  I've been trying\\nto get a good look at it on the Bruin-Sabre telecasts, and wow! does it ever\\nlook good.  Whoever did that paint job knew what they were doing.  And given\\nFuhr's play since he got it, I bet the Bruins are wishing he didn't have it:)\\n\n",

When he included that bit\\nfrom Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes\\nto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.\\nI have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely\\nhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order \\nfor many years.\\n\\nYet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back\\nso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is\\nonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed\\nwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there\\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\\n\\n\\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\\n\\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \\nKellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\\nin Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death,\\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of\\nthe 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\\nsecret of sexual magic.\\n \\n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\\nLeague founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\\n\\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership.\\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\\n\\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply\\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\\n\\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'\\n\\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \\n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\\nfor very many interpretations.\\n\\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\\nsupport of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.\\n\\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \\nWill I?  \\nI think not.\\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\\n\\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\\nI do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\\nthe Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\\n\\n\\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \\nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\\nof the organization as it stands.\\n\\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \\nI followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting\\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating\\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\\nMass well enough for my tastes.\\n \\n\\nThis doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\\nlimited contact with other members.\\n\\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\\nand the preservation of individual vision.\\n\\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\\nto other posts in this thread.\\n\\n\\nInvoke me under my stars.
